# SeriesChecker
SeriesChecker helps iRacing enthusiasts manage owned content and plan race participation efficiently.

You only need to download the SeriesChecker.exe and on the first start it will check for the latest version of this repository.
If there is a new version it downloads the updated data.zip with the data for the current iRacing schedule, cars and tracks.
Make sure to save the SeriesChecker.exe in a folder where it can create new folders and files, otherwise the update via data.zip won't work.

If there are any issues let me know.
